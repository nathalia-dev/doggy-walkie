- Dog owners can add dogs. It is required to inform the name, breed, age and weight. The dog owner can use the dog description field to describe his/her dog behavior.

- To start to communicate, the dog owner must send the first message to the dog walker. The oposite is not allowed. Only after the first message, the dog_walker can look the dog owner's profile and also creates an appointment. 

- Only the dog walker is allowed to cancel the appointment. 

- Only "done appointments" could be rated/reviewed.

- When the appointment was done/completed, the dog walker must mark as a *done appointment* in the system. That way, the dog owner will be able to review the appointment.

- Once the dog owner rated the appointment, it will count as the dog walker rate. 

- The rate math is super simple: It sum all the rates values and divide by the number of appointments already reviewed. This average will be the dog_walker rate.
